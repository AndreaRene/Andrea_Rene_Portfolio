# Andrea Ren√© Presto - Development Portfolio

In this application I wanted to create a profile found [here](https://andrearene.github.io/Andrea_Rene_Portfolio/) that met the following criteria:

* A section that gives some general information about myself
* A section that showcases my work with links to each application
* A section that lists my contact information with links to each method of contact or connection
* A navigation menu that lets a potential employer quickly access each section on the page
* A unique responsive design that accomodates screen sizes ranging from 320px to 1920px
* Performant code that utilizes classes and ids in a manner that helps to accomodate potential growth

#Technology Used

* HTML
* CSS
* Miro canvas platform for planning/wireframing (see screen capture below)
